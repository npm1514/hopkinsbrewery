Chocolate malt and lactose sugar round out the flavors of this delicious dessert beer without being too sweet. Served on nitro (not available to-go)!",

      name: "Chili Mangose",
      description: "Pronounced “mane-goh-zuh”, this gose-style ale is soured naturally with lactobacillus; we then add sea salt, coriander, and chili powder into the boil and finish fermentation with a wild yeast strain we picked up in the Uintas. Mango puree and grilled jalapeno peppers are added to the fermenter. Mango gives the impression of sweetness and the tartness melds beautifully with the salt and spicy flavors.",

      name: "Strawberry Sorghum",

Sorghum is a type of grass that originates from Africa and was used in ancient African brewing - they still use it commercially today. This beer is light and effervescent with a nice mild tartness from the sorghum that pairs beautifully with the strawberries.",
